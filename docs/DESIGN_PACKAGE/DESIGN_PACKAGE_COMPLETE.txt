DESIGN PACKAGE COMPLETE v1.0
=============================

## Status Summary

- [x] All 15 documentation files created
- [x] Mathematical specification (15 equations) complete
- [x] Architecture and roadmap defined
- [x] Security and performance targets set
- [ ] Codebase fully implemented (in progress)
- [ ] Full production deployment (planned)

## What Is Ready

1. **Design Package**
   - Entry points: 00_READ_ME_FIRST.txt, 00_START_HERE.md, INDEX.md
   - Theory: 01_FOUNDATIONAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Specs: 02_REFERENCE_EXCAVATOR_SPEC.md
   - Math: 03_MATHEMATICAL_SPECIFICATION.md
   - Architecture: 04_SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Roadmap: 05_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
   - Cheatsheet: QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   - Roles: README_DESIGN_PACKAGE.md
   - Governance: MANIFEST.md, COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md
   - Visualization: VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt
   - Tracking: FILES_COMPLETE.txt, DESIGN_PACKAGE_COMPLETE.txt

2. **Core Decisions**
   - Use CAT 320D as reference excavator
   - Use TimescaleDB for time-series telemetry
   - Use FastAPI + Django + Celery + Redis backend stack
   - Use Nuxt 4 + Tailwind frontend
   - Use ensemble ML (LSTM + Isolation Forest)
   - Target p90 latency < 100ms

## What Comes Next

1. Implement mechanics module
   - kinematics.py (Eq. 1-3)
   - dynamics.py (Eq. 4-6)
   - hydraulics.py (Eq. 7-8)

2. Implement ML module
   - features.py (Eq. 9-12)
   - models.py (Eq. 13-14)
   - ensemble.py (Eq. 15)

3. Integrate backend API
   - /simulate
   - /predict
   - /telemetry

4. Connect frontend dashboard
   - Real-time charts
   - Alerts view
   - Telemetry explorer

5. Run full QA using COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md
